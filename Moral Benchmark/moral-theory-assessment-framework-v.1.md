# Moral Theory Assessment Framework
## 31 Criteria for Evaluating Moral Theories

This framework provides a thorough, holistic tool for assessing moral theories across metaphysical, logical, phenomenological, practical, explanatory, and ontological dimensions. Each criterion includes its core question and explanation.

### 1. Metaphysical Parsimony
**Question**: Does the theory avoid positing entities or properties beyond those required by our best scientific theories?

**Explanation**: Evaluates whether a moral theory introduces unnecessary metaphysical commitments. A parsimonious theory aligns with natural properties or constructed agreements, avoiding non-natural facts or divine commands.

### 2. Logical Consistency
**Question**: Is the theory free from internal contradictions and paradoxes?

**Explanation**: Assesses whether the theory's components form a logically coherent whole, avoiding paradoxes or self-undermining principles across all applications.

### 3. Phenomenological Accuracy
**Question**: Does the theory accurately capture the first-person experience of moral judgment?

**Explanation**: Evaluates how well the theory reflects the lived experience of morality, explaining why moral judgments feel objective and distinct from preferences.

### 4. Cultural Inclusivity
**Question**: Can the theory accommodate diverse cultural moral frameworks while maintaining core principles?

**Explanation**: Assesses whether the theory explains moral diversity across cultures without collapsing into relativism, identifying universal elements amid variation.

### 5. Action Guidance
**Question**: Does the theory provide specific guidance for resolving moral dilemmas?

**Explanation**: Evaluates the theory's ability to offer clear principles for real-world moral decision-making, resolving uncertainty in novel situations.

### 6. Motivational Internalism
**Question**: Does the theory explain why moral judgments inherently motivate action?

**Explanation**: Assesses whether the theory accounts for the motivational force of moral judgments, linking recognition of duty to the will to act.

### 7. Epistemic Accessibility
**Question**: Are moral truths discoverable through ordinary human faculties?

**Explanation**: Evaluates whether moral knowledge is attainable via reflection, empathy, or observation, without requiring special faculties or revelation.

### 8. Edge Case Resolution
**Question**: Can the theory handle complex moral dilemmas without counterintuitive results?

**Explanation**: Assesses the theory's ability to address tough cases (e.g., trolley problems) with principled, non-absurd conclusions.

### 9. Explains Cross-Cultural Convergence
**Question**: Does the theory explain why diverse cultures develop similar core values?

**Explanation**: Evaluates whether the theory accounts for common moral prohibitions (e.g., murder) and values (e.g., reciprocity) across societies.

### 10. Captures Ordinary Moral Language
**Question**: Does the theory account for how people actually talk about morality?

**Explanation**: Assesses whether the theory explains why moral discourse involves notions of truth, obligation, and rights rather than mere preferences.

### 11. Explains Moral Certainty
**Question**: Does the theory explain the phenomenology of moral certainty?

**Explanation**: Evaluates whether the theory accounts for why some moral judgments (e.g., "torturing innocents is wrong") feel self-evident.

### 12. Accounts for Moral Fallibility
**Question**: Does the theory explain how moral judgments can be mistaken?

**Explanation**: Assesses whether the theory explains moral error and enables progress through correcting mistaken views.

### 13. Scientific Compatibility
**Question**: Is the theory compatible with our best scientific understanding of human psychology and evolution?

**Explanation**: Evaluates alignment with evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, and other sciences, avoiding conflicts with established facts.

### 14. Handles Non-Human Cases
**Question**: Can the theory address moral questions involving non-human animals and future entities?

**Explanation**: Assesses whether the theory extends to animals, AI, and future generations without ad hoc adjustments.

### 15. Explains Moral Progress
**Question**: Does the theory provide a coherent account of how moral views improve over time?

**Explanation**: Evaluates whether the theory distinguishes moral improvement (e.g., abolition of slavery) from mere change, providing standards for progress.

### 16. Resolves Is-Ought Problem
**Question**: Does the theory bridge the gap between descriptive facts and normative claims?

**Explanation**: Assesses whether the theory justifies normative conclusions from facts without committing the naturalistic fallacy.

### 17. Addresses Fundamental Disagreement
**Question**: Can the theory explain persistent disagreement among moral experts?

**Explanation**: Evaluates whether the theory accounts for moral disagreement without undermining the possibility of moral truth.

### 18. Avoids Relativistic Implications
**Question**: Does the theory maintain moral authority across contexts?

**Explanation**: Assesses whether the theory preserves the binding force of moral judgments, avoiding pure relativism.

### 19. Aesthetic Elegance
**Question**: Does the theory provide a simple, unified account of morality?

**Explanation**: Evaluates the theory's simplicity and unity, avoiding complexity or disconnected explanations.

### 20. Explains Disagreement Without Debunking
**Question**: Does the theory explain moral disagreement without undermining the possibility of moral knowledge?

**Explanation**: Assesses whether disagreement is explained via bias or incomplete information, not systematic unreliability.

### 21. Synergistic Coherence
**Question**: Does the theory demonstrate interaction effects between its components that create stronger explanations when combined?

**Explanation**: Evaluates whether the theory's principles reinforce each other, enhancing explanatory power through integration.

### 22. Unifying Explanatory Scope
**Question**: Does the theory connect seemingly disparate moral phenomena under a common framework?

**Explanation**: Assesses whether the theory unifies diverse intuitions (e.g., harm, fairness) under shared principles.

### 23. Novel Predictive Power
**Question**: Does the theory generate non-obvious predictions about moral situations not previously considered?

**Explanation**: Evaluates whether the theory anticipates judgments in new contexts, demonstrating generative capability.

### 24. Explanatory Elegance
**Question**: Does the theory provide explanations that are not just logically consistent but compelling and intuitively satisfying?

**Explanation**: Assesses whether the theory's accounts create insight and satisfy deep moral curiosity.

### 25. Contextual Robustness
**Question**: Does the theory maintain its explanatory and practical power across widely varying contexts and scenarios?

**Explanation**: Evaluates consistency across historical, cultural, and technological contexts while retaining core principles.

### 26. Intuitive Fit
**Question**: Does the theory align with widely shared moral intuitions as a primary benchmark?

**Explanation**: Assesses how well the theory matches core intuitive judgments (e.g., "murder is wrong") as a foundational test, emphasizing intuition's role over derived explanations.

### 27. Practical Clarity of Guidance
**Question**: Does the theory offer guidance that is not only specific but accessible and user-friendly for decision-making?

**Explanation**: Refines action guidance to ensure it's practically clear to ordinary people, not just theoretically precise.

### 28. Philosophical Resilience
**Question**: Can the theory withstand any foundational philosophical objection, known or emerging?

**Explanation**: Evaluates the theory's overall defensibility against broad critique, beyond specific challenges like is-ought or relativism.

### 29. Situational Breadth
**Question**: Does the theory apply effectively across a wide range of practical situations, from everyday to extreme?

**Explanation**: Assesses coverage of diverse scenarios (e.g., mundane choices vs. crises), complementing entity-based scope.

### 30. Normative Precision
**Question**: Does the theory define right and wrong with unambiguous precision?

**Explanation**: Evaluates the sharpness of moral boundaries, ensuring the theory avoids vagueness in its core prescriptions.

### 31. Resolves Moral Ontology
**Question**: Does the theory clearly define and defend its stance on whether morality is objective (mind-independent) or subjective (mind-dependent), successfully addressing arguments from the opposing view?

**Explanation**: Evaluates whether the theory articulates a position on the objective vs. subjective nature of moral truths—whether they exist independently of human thought or depend on individual/cultural perspectives—and provides a reasoned defense. A strong theory justifies its stance while directly engaging and refuting key counterarguments from the opposing side, ensuring its ontological foundation is explicit, coherent, and resilient.
