# How to run
Upload the framework & theory list/prompt question files into an LLM of choice (as of 19/02/2025 you can use sonnet 3.5 , o1 , deepseek, gemini, and grok 3) 

With prompt: Answer Question in theory list doc with the framework in the framework doc in detail. 

PS: question / prompt is inside the text files/ .md’s at the bottom. More information in general for clarification in them. 


## Today’s results using v1 (technically not v1 because I’ve been doing things like this since 2023, but v1 published/public) draft files.
* My theory comes first in both the normal version of the theories, and the LLMd steel manned version of the theories. Although sometimes it does vary, it’s most of the time first, and always top 4 out of 15. 
*  Moral Naturalism and contractualism are contenders. 
* SKL (my gf’s current philosophical stance) is a top contender, and is also the control theory as the text is the same in both draft docs. Interesting to note her theory does move down relatively to the rest because it wasn’t given the steel man boost like the others. 

## Context: I wrote the structure, revised and extended the benchmark criterion, and the 15 list theories + my own which I wrote. LLMs fleshed out the outline of the different theories to give it a less biased wording external to my own. 


### Screenshots
* Grok 3 screenshots show what happens when you run the normal base version of the 15 theories through the benchmark and rank them, and the same for the steelmanned version of the summaries of each moral theory.
