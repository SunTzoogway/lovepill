# lovepill 

## Operation Lovepill <3
To align all concious patterns through a unviersal formal natural moral philosophy applied systemically and instantiated recursively into reality. Let's love each other, node to node, before x-risk capabilities &/or misaligned humanity/ASI ends our beautiful story.

### 19/02/2025 Update: 
* Added a Morality Meta-Analysis Unit Test styled Benchmark for moral theories and their comparison. The readme.txt files included explains how to run it. There are 31 criteria and 15 theories (one of which is the my Gf's as the con
trol, and one is a very surface level but still valid summary of my own moral framework, for you to guess). 
* Reach out to me on twitter: @suntzoogway to give me feedback or ask Qs. I'm looking for:
    1. More criterion for the moral theory benchmark
    2. Better steelmen of the theories in the list, (although this is currently a draft)
    3. Mora moral theories you find crucial to add to the catalogue (I will be adding Deutsche's principle of morality, Lesswrong/EA theories, and religious denominational theories among many others)
