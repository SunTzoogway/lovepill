TODO

- When you cover ALL points, consider that WIN
  - make points fade out, line remains
  - then fade out line and redirect to the static page of Love Pill & Manifesto
- If failed, make points reset 
  (fade back to the right color)

- Glow on mouse over / when line is close 


- Make the canvas span the whole screen but keep the app centered 
  (so that line drawing doesn't stop around the edges of the screen)
